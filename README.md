# RBRCountdown

This is a plugin for Richard Burns Rally that adds a countdown before the stage starts.

Big thanks to [mika-n](https://github.com/mika-n) that made the (NGPCarMenu)[https://github.com/mika-n/NGPCarMenu] plugin that this plugin is based on. If it wasn't for NGPCarMenu I would never have been able to make this plugin. Big huge shoutout!!
